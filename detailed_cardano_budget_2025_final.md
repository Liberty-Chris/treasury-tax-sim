- Product Research Sub-bucket: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: The product research bucket aims to fund all research activities that can provide user needs and market insights into the Cardano ecosystem. This research will be conducted with rigorous standards, following user and market research best practices. It will provide direct insights and direction to the ecosystem, as well as to projects within the ecosystem.

The product committee requests an overall budget range between $200k to get insights related to product research, plus any other questions that will be brought to the committee from other committees in 2025, as well as to cover costs for managing the process and making the outcome easily accessible to the community.

This budget is small being this the first year Cardano run's product research. This will allow us to structure a process and collect initial key insights.

- : **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Structure research strategy and perform research to give insights to key questions from this list

- Vision Creation Sub-bucket: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: The vision creation bucket aims to fund all activities needed to facilitate the first version of a community-led open and transparent process to create an evolving 5-year vision for the Cardano ecosystem.

We're budgeting for up to 100 workshops (in-person and remote) supported by Intersect hubs, coming to a total of $200k requests for vision creation with a commitment to return the remaining funds at the end of the vision creation process if the funds are not fully spent. We don't see a need for professional services as we're going to be developing this in an open-source volunteer fashion.

- : **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Support for up to 100 workshops (in-person or remote), and management of the process.

- Product Committee Overhead Sub-bucket: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: This sub-bucket aims to cover any overhead the product committee itself might have in facilitating and managing the three buckets above as well as delivering against its core objectives (support vision and roadmap creation as well as keeping track of its progress)

Examples of items that might be covered with this small overhead budget are:
- Academic Research tenders proposals review
- Product research tenders proposals review
- Vision creation process coordination and management
- Product research analysis

Considering an estimation to cover the examples above, plus anything small that is currently unforeseen the committee asks $100k

## Technical Steering
- : **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Background Information
- 2025 & 2026 Budgets: Many of the development projects within the TSC budget require an effort of greater than 6 months. Thereofore in order to prevent the risk projects having to start and stop, causing increased costs and delays. The TSC is proposing, where required, to allocate 2026 budget to help improve the certainty required deliver on development projects. 
- Proposal Backlog: The community is open to put forward development projects to improve the Core Cardano Network these are collate into a Core Cardano public backlog. 
- Public Backlog Prioritisation:  Anyone in the community can take part in the prioritisation of proposals using the Core Roadmap Prioritisation Form.

- Title: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Description

- Core Maintenance: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Contract Type: From Feb-July this will take the form an engineering call-off agreement for engineering resource up to a maximum of value of $10m IOE.  This is due to the fact that without a budget in place it has not been possible to put this  work to open tender yet and so the existing IOE maintenance team will continue to be engaged until there is access to the treasury. Once the budget is approved, the ambition of the TSC is that these maintenance work activities will be broken up and put to open tender to the community for the second half of 2025. 
Hours to be spent on the backlog as reviewed and approved by the Technical Steering Committee. From July onward, 

The full list of work covered under maintenance can be found here: full list of maintenance items. 
 

- Integration & Rollout: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Integration is defined as the work that is needed to complete development and produce a fully integrated, tested and released version of the node.  This work includes benchmarking, post-integration testing, security evaluation, and any changes to documentation.  It also includes any fixes/changes that need to be made to the code, and any interfacing to node components.  Rollout includes the work that is needed to support new users of the feature, deployment on testnets as necessary, any patches/improvements that need to made to address issues that are found in practical use. 
eg: Integration of Ouroboros Genesis, Integration of UTxO LMDB, Integration of UTxO LSM

- Core Maintenance: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Core maintenance is defined as 'essential ongoing work on the node and associated software that is required to keep the blockchain from degrading'. Core Maintenance is the most essential activity of the core budget. Not having a core maintenance budget would effectively stall any realistic goal or project deployment. It is essential to maintaining a secure and stable end system. 
e.g: Technical Debt, Bug Fixing, E2E Testing, Security Improvements, Maintenance activities for API, CLI, DB-Sync, Plutus Core etc.

- Support: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Support is defined as the activities that are needed to ensure that the node can be built and released in an efficient and secure way.  This includes ensuring that any compiler issues that arise during node development are properly handled and that any 3rd party libraries are up-to-date and that any bugs in library code or efficiency issues that impact the node are resolved properly.
e.g: Release Management, Haskell Compiler Support, 3rd Party Library Maintenance.

- Operational: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Operational costs are defined as the expenses that are incurred through the normal operation of the maintenance process.  These include data centre and similar costs. 
e.g: Operate the bootstrap relay nodes that enable new users to join the network (no longer needed once Ouroboros Genesis has been fully rolled out)., CI/CD Operations (node release), Maintain Testnets.

- Community: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Activities specifically related to community engagement eg: Hard Fork Coordination, Product Bug Bounty, Blog posts and other communication activities

- AWS Costs: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Amazon Web Services

- : **0 ADA**

- Roadmap Development: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Contract Type: Typically these will be a a series of fixed payment milestone contracts with set delivereables and payment on sign off of completion

This portion of the budget is for Development Projects related to improving and enhancing the core network and aligned to at least one of the Product Committee Goals: 1. Attracting more dApps & Users, 2. Making Carano easier to use, 3. Enabling Decentralised Governaance, 4. Maintaining Cardano's current qualities.

Project Maturity Level: Typically these projects are at SRL Level 5 or Above

Process: 
- Project Submission: Anyone within the community can submit a new proposal or initiative related to core development. The process is outlined here: How to Participate in Shaping the Tecnical Roadmap.
- Proposed projects are shared on the public backlog of potential Roadmap products. 
-Projects for the roadmap have been proposed through the Triage group, and will be prioritised through engagement with community & dReps. 
-The number of projects undertaken will be scaled to fit the budget approved. A larger Roadmap Development budget will enable a great number of development projects proposals to be undertaken a smaller budget will mean a smaller development roadmap.
-Below are a list of projects that have been approved for Tender to date.
-The below have not yet been put out to tender so all costs are estimates based on FTE estimates and standard engineering day rates

Uncommitted Budget: 
In any large scale delivery, product, project or programme there are unforeseen eventualities and events which may need to be acted upon at relatively short notice. This may include responses to security events and emerging CIPs such as CIP-69 in 2024.
A proportion of the development budget has been deliverately left unalloacted in order to enable community members to come forward with additional proposals or to take part in further rounds of prioritisations as outlined above.

- Midgard Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup [Recommended for Tender]: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Midgard is a layer 2 optimistic rollup for Cardano. It has a tokenless design. All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions onchain but in a more compact form

Effort: 1 Year Project to complete with a team of 5-6

- Hydra Development [Recommended for Tender]: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Hydra is a L2 scaling solution, an isomorphic multi-party state channel. This enables a fixed set of people to create an off-chain ledger with custom parameters, execute transactions and smart contracts, and only settle agreed upon states, to L1, incrementally and upon closure.
Comment

- Ouroboros Leios 
[Recommended for Tender]: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Whereas in a classical blockchain the block bodies directly contain transactions, in Leios the block bodies can also contain references to Endorser Blocks which themselves contain references to so-called Input Blocks containing the actual transactions. Those references are certified through a voting mechanism that guarantees a majority of validators agree on the content of Endorser Blocks.

- Ouroboros Peras 
[Recommended for Tender]: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Peras modifies the chain-selection rule to include the “boosting” of the dominant chain's blocks by a quorum of votes from periodic randomly-selected voting committees. It modifies the chain-selection rule, the CDDL of the block body, and the creation, transport, and verification of votes and the certificates that witness a quorum of votes. It adds several new protocol parameters.

- Revised Stakepool Incentive Scheme 
[Recommended for Tender]: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Several proposals have been made to adjust the current stake pool incentives scheme. A particular concern is that of providing smoother incentives for smaller pools. This project will investigate this important issue, considering the merits of existing proposals, identifying possible improvements to the current scheme with costs/benefits, and outlining a development plan if successful.

- Nested Transactions
[Recommended for Tender]: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: We propose implementing Nested Transactions, a change to the current ledger design to support a specific kind of transaction batching. This design supports swap intents, by allowing individual transactions in a batch to be unbalanced, but the full batch itself must be balanced. We interpret Babel fees as swap intent. We include several related ledger changes for the purpose of demonstrating the extensibility of this framework to support additional kinds of intents, inclusion of which in the production implementation is optional.

- Further Core Cardano Devlopment Projects as proposed and reviewed by the community: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Further Core Development work from proposals submitted by the community:  Core Backlog proposals can be found here.

- Non-Roadmap Development: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: 
Contract Type: Typically these will be a a series of fixed payment milestone contracts with set delivereables and payment on sign off of completion

Community proposed development items that do not directly align with one of the Product Committee Priority Areas, but which deliver high value to the Cardano core infrastructure. These will be identified and managed in the same manner at the Roadmap Developmenet proposals but enables projects demonstrate community need or benefit that relate to core development to have a route for funding. 

Link to the backlog of Core Backlog proposals can be found here.

- Research: **0 ADA**
  - _Description_: Contract Type: Fixed-price contract. Cost associated with the work fulfilled as opposed to hours worked. 

Project Maturity Level: Typically these projects are at SRL Level 5 or Below

TSC: Remit over Research budget is related to specific queries / applied research and some early phase discovery activities. 

Some Roadmap development work relates to proposals with low levels of maturity that require further research before development and will therefore come from the Research & Innovation budget. 
These proposals sit at Software Readiness Level 4 or Less. 

Process: 
- Project Submission: Anyone within the community can submit a new proposal or initiative related to core development. The process is outlined here: How to Participate in Shaping the Tecnical Roadmap.
- Proposed projects are shared on the public backlog of potential Roadmap products. 
-Projects for the roadmap have been proposed through the Triage group, and will be prioritised through engagement with community & dReps. 
-The number of projects undertaken will be scaled to fit the budget approved. A larger Roadmap Development budget will enable a great number of development projects proposals to be undertaken a smaller budget will mean a smaller development roadmap.
