- Academic Research sub-bucket: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: The Academic research bucket aims to fund all research activities that can provide long-term insights into the Cardano ecosystem.

The Academic Research sub-bucket is separated into Academic research and Academic innovation.

We propose a budget of $13.42M. The total budget proposed is to finance all supplier activities across both academic research and innovation with a total of 56.1 FTEs. This equates to an average of circa $239k per FTE (or $1,030 per day based on 232 working days per year) including all costs as outlined below. This includes a shared services allocation of 15% (below industry standards of 20-25%) as well as all other costs including equipment, software licenses, server costs, any sub-contracting that may be required (for example to academic partners or third-party engineers), travel costs, events and program and portfolio management.

The committee aims to start funding this work from June onwards via a tendering process (assuming that's the time when the budget will become available)

- Academic research: State-Machine Contract Environment: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: As part of the work on Hydra protocols, we observed that we can greatly simplify the development of smart contracts for Cardano by utilising a state-machine-based abstraction that hides many of the intricacies of the EUTxO model [1, 2] and provides a more declarative notion of smart contracts. This has led to the development of a formal framework tentatively called EasySM that takes care of all recurring mechanisms required for state-machine-based contracts on EUTxO.
  - **Explanation:** Retained as a necessary expense for strategic development.

- Academic research: Location-based services and smart contracts: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: (1) Location-based services describe interactions and state-transitions in a blockchain which are dependent on the location of the node (or the user of said node) during the point in time when the state-transition is elicited (ie. location-based payments or smart contracts). 

Examples includes (a) a user being automatically billed when walking through a turnstile gate to access shared infrastructure (b) the execution of a smart contract which leads to a different outcome depending on the location of (the majority of) the consensus nodes. (If the consensus layer becomes too “decentralized”, funds might stay ‘locked’) (c) location information obtained from the user’s node can facilitate governance and country or zone specific rules in decentralized finance applications. 

(2) In addition to location-based user functionality, node location in a blockchain is crucial for the consensus layer. Geographic diversity can mitigate geo-political influence, natural disasters, and potentially even eclipse attacks on the network. Geographic diversity can only be assessed truthfully when taking the Internet topology (underlying architecture such as submarine cables, etc)  into account. 

The main open questions are therefore: (a) how can we measure the geographic diversity of a decentralized system that is built on the Internet (b) how can we design incentives such that the stakeholders of the system gravitate towards a stable equilibrium where the locations of the nodes are as diverse as possible

- Academic research: Ouroboros Peras (Vision): **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: The Cardano ledger is currently maintained by Ouroboros Praos, a longest-chain type of proof-of-stake consensus protocol. These protocols exhibit several desirable robustness features including tolerance to fluctuating participation and self-healing from temporary periods of adversarial dominance. 

However, a well-understood downside of longest-chain consensus is that it only provides gradual settlement, requiring a sufficient number of blocks to appear on top of a transaction of interest to consider it settled. This property of the mainchain might impede adoption and complicate deployment of various layer-2 functionalities envisioned for the Cardano ecosystem. 
  - **Explanation:** Retained as a necessary expense for strategic development.

- Academic research: Ouroboros Leios: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: The current Ouroboros design (Praos) is almost at its limits with respect to throughput, as increasing the block production rate or block size further may negatively affect the protocol’s security. Moreover, Praos only partially takes advantage of the available resources in the network (network bandwidth / cpu / memory); on expectation one block of size ~100 KB is sent every 20 seconds.  On the other hand, increasing throughput to meet demand is key to serving Cardano’s vision of being part of the infrastructure of an ecosystem of blockchains / sidechains. 

To this end, Leios aims to be the first protocol in the Ouroboros family where throughput is proportional to the resources available to individual nodes. Moreover, the goal is for throughput to scale vertically, i.e, the system’s performance should scale as more resources are provided to the machines running the system–doubling the resources of all machines in the system should result in approximately double the throughput.

- Academic research: Fair transaction processing: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: Ouroboros, similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum L1 consensus protocols, does not offer any guarrantees regarding "fairness" in terms of transaction processing. In particular this means that there are no guarrantees against front running or preferential ordering in the way transactions are organized in the ledger. In the Ethereum ecosystem this has been described as both a problem and opportunity in the context of Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Nevertheless, the resulting modifications such as proposer builder separation have also negative effects such as increased centralization of the L1 operation. In this thread, we develop techniques for ensuring fairness of transaction processing as a default feature of the underlying blockchain protocol. This will require modifications in the L1 as well as novel cryptographic techniques to be developed, analyzed and implemented.  
  - **Explanation:** Retained as a necessary expense for strategic development.

- Academic research: Multi-resource consensus - Minotaur: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: Multi-resource consensus refers to permissionless consensus where the right to produce a block is derived from proving possession of different resources, e.g., a mixture of proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS), as opposed to just standard PoW or PoS. Relying on more than one single resource can give stronger security guarantees than relying just on a single resource. For example, consensus solely based on PoW cannot tolerate a dishonest majority of computing resources, while basing it on PoW and PoS can tolerate it (by compensating with a lower corruption level on the PoS side).

Multi-resource consensus is particularly useful to secure the bootstrapping of new blockchains as follows. Assume you want to launch a new PoS blockchain to be eventually controlled by its native asset. Initially the asset is illiquid, the stake distribution might be very imbalanced, and not all stakeholders might be ready to actively participate in stake delegation or block production. Initially mixing in different assets to control the sidechain via (restaked) PoS now helps to keep the system stable as the holders of those assets are already up and running, and prepared to support the new sidechain.

- Academic research: Proofs of useful work: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: The main motivation for this research direction is to employ any significant computational effort performed to solve real-world problems such as, scheduling, protein folding, and others, as a resource for securing an underlying consensus protocol. Via multi-resource consensus, this can benefit the Cardano ecosystem both in terms of increasing security and in terms of providing an on ramp to the ecosystem via computational effort, while simultaneously not incurring any energy wastage as in the case with PoW systems. 

The main mechanism to do this is Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) schemes, which allow securely integrating blockchain protocols with useful computations. While long being discussed, manifestations of this idea have been limited to non-widely useful computations, such as those employed in Primecoin. In 2022, IOG researchers published the first instance of Ofelimos, a provably secure PoUW protocol, focusing on local search algorithms for hard computational problems such as SAT. Future research will investigate extending PoUWs to other domains, such as proving zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) for blockchain state proofs, training large machine learning models and solving large scale hard optimization problems.

- Academic research: Congestion control: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: Current congestion control solutions typically employ transaction fees, primarily based on two designs: flat fees (e.g. on Cardano) or dynamic fees set through a per block auction (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum). In either design, all associated costs, such as storage, bandwidth or computation are lumped together into one final price that the transaction issuer needs to pay. In addition, transactions have no way to declare their urgency and must either accept the current level of fees for immediate service or pay less, anticipating lower congestion in the future. 

Because dynamic fees increase with demand that cannot be met due to limited blockchain scaling, they are generally unpredictable and harder to budget for. Flat fees can offer a more predictable experience, but only during periods of low to moderate demand. Otherwise, they are susceptible to cheap DoS attacks, cannot provide the immediate service required for DeFi and cannot differentiate between high and low value traffic.

- Academic research: Tokenomics design: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: We will investigate first principles in tokenomics to inform optimal long-term macroeconomic token policies for the Cardano ecosystem. The evolution of token prices over time is crucial in all blockchains in order to (i) maintain system security and (ii) incentivize larger adoption by the users. 
  - **Explanation:** Retained as a necessary expense for strategic development.

- Academic research: Rewards sharing and transaction fees: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: An important component in blockchain systems in order to achieve a successful level of decentralized operation is the proper incentivization of participating users. Towards this goal, the main toolkit for incentivizing desirable behavioral patterns is the design of appropriate reward schemes, e.g., as used for distributing revenues from block production and transaction fees. 

Reward schemes within blockchains introduce additional challenges related to anonymity, player asymmetries (i.e., SPO vs delegators of a pool), and the desire for decentralized solutions. But Sybil attacks and decentralization aspects are often ignored in the more traditional models of revenue distribution and coalition formation. Although we have seen the emergence of more appropriate reward schemes in the last few years, there is undoubtedly ample room for improvement and for coming up with better solutions that would achieve even more satisfactory performance.

- Academic research: Decentralized identity and reputation management: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: A global identity system is expected to allow everybody access to a reliable identity that can be used seamlessly through different digital platforms, and gives full control of their identity(ies) to end users, including letting them choose what information is made accessible by third parties.

Foundations: The notion of global identity we derive must be independent of concrete instantiations. However, it is also desirable to, at this point, think of generic ways to build it. In this regard, leveraging abstractions of related lower-level building blocks is desirable. For instance, a construction of a global identity notion will (most likely) require roots of trust and credentials. For the former, we will need to rely on formal notions of generalized PKIs, likely including DID-based PKIs. Similarly, for the latter, we will need to rely on formal notions of generalized credential systems, including VCs and ACs. Therefore, as a second derivative of defining a notion for global identity, we will be looking into formally defining generic and formal abstractions of these components. It can be expected that, by formally defining these components, we identify tradeoffs in the different ways to build them: for instance, an X509-based PKI may not achieve certain properties that a DID-based achieves, or vice versa. Thus, this study may serve to establish guidelines for building a global identity system, depending on the desired properties.

Concrete Instantiations: With a well-defined notion of a global identity, including a first general design built on top of ideal (and also general) building blocks, we can start looking at possible constructions. While during the definition of the global identity notion and its building blocks we will likely come up with generic constructions, they will likely not be the most efficient ones, and fine tuning will be needed for them to achieve practicality. The focus of this work package will be to come up with concrete instantiations that do achieve practicality – both in terms of computational and communication costs, as well as the required engineering effort to bring them to reality.

Applications: The questions we will try to answer in this work package are devoted to studying the concrete needs that these applications may have from a global identity system, and the mutual relationship between the global identity system, and the applications themselves – for instance, as sources of further identity information. Concretely: “What properties from the global identity system are needed by the chosen applications?”, “How can the global identity system extract identity information from these applications?” Concretely, the latter may have an interesting variant, which looks into “How can identity information in system A be ‘moved’ to system B?” (where system A and system B may, for instance, be different blockchains).

Integration: For a global identity system to be really global, it needs to be integrated within the larger identity space. This has two variants: (1) integrating the derived notion of global identity into the existing identity space; and (2) integrating the constructions achieved in concrete instantiations into the applications designed.

- Academic research: Next-level governance protocols: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: A central theme in Cardano’s vision is the deployment of systems that help the management and long-term sustainability of its blockchain ecosystem, clarifying how its core and external contributors should collaborate. Governance protocols, and in particular voting protocols, can support a variety of decision-making procedures (representative, stake based, or delegative/liquid amongst others) with participation from most of the blockchain stakeholders and thus, are a key enabler of this vision. Existing e-voting protocols, however, are typically designed for non-blockchain settings, and often assume centralized services for tallying and/or recording of the votes. Recent proposals aim to make use of off-the-shelf protocols and additionally utilize a ledger to decentralize some aspects of the voting. Implementing such solutions and integrating them with Cardano may come with an unacceptably high main chain footprint, which in turn makes their running costs too high for blockchain governance.

  - **Explanation:** Retained as a necessary expense for strategic development.

- Academic research: Governance incentives: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: Governance incentives refer to the alignment of the goals of participants of a blockchain ecosystem. While sufficient robustness has been achieved, it is difficult to balance swift and effective decision making with the fundamental blockchain principles of decentralization, security, transparency, and fairness. This is particularly challenging now that the set of blockchain participants has been expanded and cannot be adequately captured just by the number of tokens owned by each wallet.

- Academic research: Hydra Tail: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: The Hydra suite of protocols is a key component of Cardano’s layer-2 scarling solutions. Hydra Tail follows the states-channel Hydra Head protocol. Tail is a zk-rollup solution that processes a batch of transactions off-chain and reduces on-chain computation and storage needs by providing a summary (roll-up) of the transactions performed. Clients can safely move funds and smart contracts back and forth between the blockchain and the off-chain protocol. Hydra Tail, like Hydra Head, will provide safeguards against censorship of clients and reduce trust assumptions on servers through a (sound) ZK proof system.

We expect the Hydra Tail state machine to take a form as follows. The contract starts at the initial state. And after appropriate checks it transitions to the open state where clients can commit funds to L2; the server can collect committed funds, and in regular intervals updates snapshots to L1. In case of a recall (e.g., because a transaction gets censored by the server) a client can advance the state machine to the failed state. In this state, all clients have the opportunity to reclaim/recall their committed funds. Once a sufficiently long period of time passes (or the server decides to “retire”), the state machine transitions to the closed state. A special registered transaction (regTx) operation allows users to circumvent censorship.

- Academic research: Inter-Head: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: Layer-2 refers to a family of blockchain protocols that aim to improve the blockchain's scalability. These protocols let parties lock their funds on-chain into a channel structure, which facilitates interactions between participating parties that can transact with another off-chain a potentially arbitrary amount of times and only result in a footprint of at most a constant number of on-chain transactions. Solutions range from simple two-party payment channels to isomorphic multi-party state channels [1], i.e., the Hydra Protocol. Further work builds up extends it, for instance, creation of multi-party state channel networks [2], i.e., the Interhead Protocol. However, a common drawback of these works - with the exception of a few cases - is a lack of formal security treatment, where formalization in the Universal Composability (UC) Framework [3] is considered the state of the art in the field. 
  - **Explanation:** Retained as a necessary expense for strategic development.

- Academic research: Optimization tools: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: The Hydra Suite of protocols is a family of protocols for layer-2, and therefore it shares common characteristics of other existing layer-2 protocols, such as payment channels, state and virtual channels. For a smooth operation over the Hydra based network, optimized protocols are required to address issues like funds rebalancing, message routing and head synchronization. For example, the locking of collateral funds can be essential to enable securing transactions. Furthermore, the capacity of such a multiparty, or pair-wise, channel funds the transactions, however the accumulation of asymmetric flows of funds may deplete such capacity, hence no further transactions occur in the channel.  While other channel capacity securing a different channel may still be allocated but unused. Other potential limitations exist.
  - **Explanation:** Retained as a necessary expense for strategic development.

- Academic research: Auditing tools: **200000 ADA**
  - _Description_: Layer-2 solutions such payment channels, state channels, or virtual channels provide increased throughput and settlement speed to layer-1 of a blockchain system by having parties perform off-chain payments (or in general: state transitions), only coming back to the layer-1 chain if the funds must be claimed for a different context. As such they are the prime solution for scaling. In the context of Cardano, the Hydra protocol suite is realizing the full potential of layer 2. Such state channels have, however, a drawback that cannot be ignored: after committing funds on layer-1, all transactions are off-chain and potentially private and discussions emerge about the balance between privacy and accountability in this context. Instead of state channels behaving like black holes with respect to the actual transaction history, it would be beneficial if the Hydra protocol suite is equipped with a new mode that allows for controlled and reliable access to the crucial information about its transaction history by an accredited auditor; a mode that strikes a good balance between privacy, auditability, and accountability.

- Academic research: Light client infrastructure: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: This project has the potential for several publishable units spanning a duration of at least three years. The starting position is the lack of light client functionality in the Cardano ecosystem. The research proposed in this project shall address said shortcoming with the aim to devise a client infrastructure that is prepared for future needs and developments such as the looming asymmetry in data retention of different clients, bandwidth and processing limitations of certain devices as well as competitive end-to-end latency goals for user applications.
  - **Explanation:** Retained as a necessary expense for strategic development.

- Academic research: Consensus Innovation: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: The research on consensus protocols in the blockchain era has sparked a variety of new paradigms, both from the distributed computing community and from the cryptographic community. The seminal Bitcoin paper let the communities rethink under what assumptions achieving consensus is possible. Roughly, two main paradigms have emerged over the past decade: one paradigm is the so-called Nakamoto-consensus, which, roughly speaking, are protocols where participants are supposed to extend a longest chain, where the resources dictate with what probability a particular party is allowed or elected to extend the chain. Consensus is reached over time, where parties agree on the blocks on the longest chain, except for possibly the most recent couple of blocks. 

The second paradigm is porting prior results on BFT consensus to the blockchain setting, either taking Feldman-Micali style BFT protocols as basis, or PBFT by Liskov as a foundation. A large body of literature has followed both paradigms and brought them into the permissionless and permissioned, most notably the Hotstuff line of work represents the evolution of PBFT, while Algorand represents the evolution of graded-consensus in the blockchain era. It is clear that by no means we have reached the peak in the innovation and development of new paradigms for consensus. This research stream captures several directions in which known consensus approaches can be developed and implemented, and new paradigms can be investigated.

- Academic innovation: Leios: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: Ouroboros Leios is a high-throughput protocol for Cardano. It is designed to maximise the use of available network bandwidth and therefore maximise overall throughput of the network, all while maintaining the strong security properties of the Ouroboros family of protocols. Being agnostic of the underlying Nakomoto consensus protocol, Ouroboros Leios can support a wide range of applications. This innovation workstream for Leios aims to evaluate the protocol’s viability for practical use and to advance the protocol’s maturity from the research stage to a stage where development for eventual deployment can begin.

- Academic innovation: Anti-Grinding: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: The theoretical estimates for Cardano mainchain settlement times are significantly influenced by the potential impact of a "grinding attack." To reduce this effect and achieve faster settlement times, this stream focuses on evaluating protocol changes that would make such attacks considerably more expensive for adversaries. By increasing the cost of a grinding attack, the protocol limits adversaries—who possess a certain amount of computational power—forcing them to carry out a much weaker form of the attack.

- Academic innovation: RSnarks: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: This stream focuses on recursive SNARKs, which enable iterative aggregation of multiple proofs into a single, succinct proof, broadening the range of applications for privacy and scalability. A key application is the efficient proving of state progression in blockchain systems, such as enabling a trustless zk-bridge between Cardano and partnerchains. To achieve this, the workstream adapts the Halo2 proving system, utilizing Pluto-Eris curves and KZG commitments for smaller proofs and faster verification. The current focus is the translation of Halo2-Pluto proofs into Halo2-BLS proofs, which can be efficiently verified on Cardano. This involves complex recursive arithmetic and smart contract development, aiming to demonstrate feasibility and scalability of these innovations for blockchain ecosystems.

- Academic innovation: Proof of Restake: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: Hybrid consensus systems combine two or more different consensus algorithms to leverage their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. This approach enables the creation of a more robust, scalable, and secure consensus mechanism.

The Minotaur project aims to provide tooling for bootstrapping a new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains called Minotaur Chains. The primary challenge is the initial lack of stake distribution, which poses a security risk for a new chain. To address this, the project proposes leveraging existing stakes from established chains like Cardano and Ethereum to create a "Virtual Stake" on the Minotaur chain. This allows initial participants to secure the Minotaur network using their existing stakes on these chains.

The solution involves a dynamic conversion rate between the actual stakes on Cardano, Ethereum, and Minotaur, based on USD price oracles. The Virtual Stake is also defined by a list of weights for each chain. Validators from Cardano and Ethereum can register their participation on the Minotaur chain using their existing stakes (process called re-staking) and engaging with smart contracts on Cardano and Ethereum, ensuring the initial security of the Minotaur network. Over time, as Minotaur
coins are minted and staked, the Virtual Stake will gradually shift to prioritize Minotaur stakes.

- Academic innovation: Proof of Useful Work: **No ADA Amount Specified ADA**
  - _Description_: To design a consensus protocol where, instead of doing useless computations (e.g., hashes), one performs useful work during the mining process. In addition, to solve real-world problems such as, scheduling, protein folding, and others, as a resource for securing an underlying consensus protocol. Via multi-resource consensus, this can benefit the Cardano ecosystem both in terms of increasing security and providing an on ramp to the ecosystem via computational effort, while simultaneously not incurring any energy wastage as in the case with PoW systems.The requirements for this novel approach to "useful" compute within MLOps is a desirable, viable and sustainable forward-path as part of a progressive AI strategy.
